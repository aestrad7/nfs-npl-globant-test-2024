# Abstracts Segmentation

1. This repository contains an exercise in segmenting abstracts (summaries) using two different approaches:
   1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with KMeans
   2. OpenAI embeddings obtained through their API and KMeans

- ## Project Structure

  - `src/`
    - `data/`: Contains scripts for data loading and preprocessing.
    - `features/`: Contains scripts for feature extraction.
    - `models/`: Contains scripts for model construction and evaluation.
    - `utils/`: Contains utility functions used in different parts of the project.
  - `data/`: Directory where input data is stored.
  - `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with exploratory analysis and model testing.
  - `requirements.txt`: File with the project dependencies.
  - `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, use the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with the following command:

```
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The `data/` directory should contain the necessary data files for the project. Ensure that the data is preprocessed and ready to be used in the models.

## Methodology

### Approach 1: TF-IDF with KMeans

1. **Preprocessing**: The texts of the abstracts are tokenized, and stopwords are removed.
2. **Vectorization**: TF-IDF is used to convert the texts into numerical vectors.
3. **Clustering**: KMeans is applied to group the abstracts into different clusters.

### Approach 2: OpenAI Embeddings with KMeans

1. **Obtain Embeddings**: The OpenAI API is used to obtain embeddings of the texts of the abstracts.
2. **Clustering**: KMeans is applied to the obtained embeddings to group the abstracts into different clusters.

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

```
from importer import Importer

imp = Importer()
archivos_full = imp.abstract_names_function(path)
muestra = imp.abstract_sampler(archivos_full)
```

### Feature Extraction

For TF-IDF:

```
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.8, min_df=3, max_features=3323, stop_words='english')
tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df_abstracts['clean_abstract'])
```

For OpenAI Embeddings:

```
titles = df['clean_abstract'].tolist()
embeddings = [embeddings_model.embed_query(title) for title in titles]
```
